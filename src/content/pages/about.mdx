## What is Shakuhachi.ro?

Shakuhachi.ro is a website for discovering, sharing, and creating shakuhachi scores. Whether you're learning a new piece or sharing your favorites with other players, this website makes it easy to work with shakuhachi notation online.

This project is inspired by [The Sessions](https://thesession.org/), a community website dedicated to Irish traditional music, and [Flat.io](https://flat.io/), a website to compose, collaborate, and publish western notation sheet music online.

## How to Use

### Browse Scores

The library on the home page shows all available scores. You can search by title or composer to find what you're looking for.

### Create a Score

Click "Create score" to start a new score. Enter your notation, give it a title, and save to publish it. The score renders live as you type so you can see what it looks like immediately.

### Fork a Score

**What is forking?** Forking creates your own editable copy of a score. This is useful when you want to make personal modifications—like adding your own fingering notes, changing the notation, or adapting the piece for your skill level.

Your forked copy is completely independent. Changes you make won't affect the original score, and you can edit it freely.

To fork a score: view any score and click the "Fork" button. You'll get your own copy that you can edit and share.

## Notation Formats

The platform supports three input formats:

- **JSON** — The native format for this platform. A structured way to describe each note's pitch, octave, and duration directly.
- **MusicXML** — Industry-standard format used by notation software like Finale, Sibelius, and MuseScore. Useful for importing existing scores.
- **ABC notation** — A text-based music notation format popular in folk and traditional music communities.

All three formats are interchangeable in the editor—you can switch between them and the content will be automatically converted.

## Open Source

Shakuhachi.ro is an open-source project. The code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/chrisrauh/shakuhachi-ro).

The shakuhachi notation renderer is also available as a standalone library that developers can use in their own projects.

### Using the Renderer

The easiest way to embed shakuhachi notation on any website is using the `<shakuhachi-score>` web component.

For developers using npm packages, you can also import the ScoreRenderer class directly:

```typescript
import { ScoreRenderer } from 'shakuhachi-ro';

const renderer = new ScoreRenderer(container);
await renderer.renderFromScoreData({ /* score data */ });
```

### Live Example

Below is a live example showing the opening phrase of "Akatombo" (Red Dragonfly), a beloved Japanese folk song. The code shows exactly how to embed shakuhachi notation on any website:

```html
<!-- Include the script once in your HTML -->
<script src="https://shakuhachi.ro/embed/shakuhachi-score.js"></script>

<!-- Default: auto-detect columns based on container height -->
<shakuhachi-score data-score='{...}'></shakuhachi-score>

<!-- Single column with intrinsic height -->
<shakuhachi-score columns="1" data-score='{
  "title": "Akatombo (Opening Phrase)",
  "style": "kinko",
  "notes": [
    { "pitch": { "step": "ro", "octave": 0 }, "duration": 1 },
    { "pitch": { "step": "tsu", "octave": 0 }, "duration": 1 },
    { "pitch": { "step": "tsu", "octave": 0 }, "duration": 2, "dotted": true },
    { "pitch": { "step": "chi", "octave": 0 }, "duration": 1 },
    { "pitch": { "step": "ri", "octave": 0 }, "duration": 1 },
    { "pitch": { "step": "ro", "octave": 1 }, "duration": 1 },
    { "pitch": { "step": "u", "octave": 1 }, "duration": 1 },
    { "pitch": { "step": "hi", "octave": 1 }, "duration": 1 },
    { "pitch": { "step": "ro", "octave": 1 }, "duration": 2 }
  ]
}'>
</shakuhachi-score>

<!-- Explicit column count (6 columns) -->
<shakuhachi-score columns="6" data-score='{...}'></shakuhachi-score>
```

**Live result:**

<div class="score-example">
  <shakuhachi-score class="score-viz" columns="1" data-score='{"title":"Akatombo (Opening Phrase)","style":"kinko","notes":[{"pitch":{"step":"ro","octave":0},"duration":1},{"pitch":{"step":"tsu","octave":0},"duration":1},{"pitch":{"step":"tsu","octave":0},"duration":2,"dotted":true},{"pitch":{"step":"chi","octave":0},"duration":1},{"pitch":{"step":"ri","octave":0},"duration":1},{"pitch":{"step":"ro","octave":1},"duration":1},{"pitch":{"step":"u","octave":1},"duration":1},{"pitch":{"step":"hi","octave":1},"duration":1},{"pitch":{"step":"ro","octave":1},"duration":2}]}'></shakuhachi-score>
  <div class="score-comments">
    **What you're seeing:**
    - **Vertical reading**: Notes read top to bottom, then move to the next column
    - **Octave markers**: The 乙 (otsu, lower octave) and 甲 (kan, upper octave) characters above notes indicate which register to play in
    - **Duration dots**: The dot below the third note extends its duration by half (like western notation)
    - **Traditional characters**: Shakuhachi uses Japanese katakana-based characters (ロ、ツ、レ、チ、リ、ウ、ヒ) to represent finger holes
