## What is Shakuhachi.ro?

Shakuhachi.ro is a website for discovering, sharing, and creating shakuhachi scores. Whether you're learning a new piece or sharing your favorites with other players, this websitr makes it easy to work with shakuhachi notation online.

This project is inspired by [The Sessions](https://thesession.org/), a community website dedicated to Irish traditional music, and Flat.io, a website to compose, collaborate, and publish western notation sheet music online.

## How to Use

### Fork a Score

**What is forking?** Forking creates your own editable copy of a score. This is useful when you want to make personal modifications—like adding your own fingering notes, changing the notation, or adapting the piece for your skill level.

Your forked copy is completely independent. Changes you make won't affect the original score, and you can edit it freely.

To fork a score: view any score and click the "Fork" button. You'll get your own copy that you can edit and share.

## Notation Formats

The platform supports multiple notation input formats including MusicXML, JSON score data, and ABC notation. This flexibility allows you to work with scores from different sources or transcription tools.

## Open Source

Shakuhachi.ro is an open-source project. The code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/chrisrauh/shakuhachi-ro).

The shakuhachi notation renderer is also available as a standalone library that developers can use in their own projects.

### Using the Renderer

Here's a simple example of how to use the renderer in your own project:

```typescript
import { ScoreRenderer } from 'shakuhachi-ro';

// Create a renderer instance
const renderer = new ScoreRenderer(container);

// Render a score from a URL
await renderer.renderFromURL('/path/to/score.musicxml');

// Or render from score data
await renderer.renderFromScoreData({
  key: 'D',
  style: 'kinko',
  notes: [
    { pitch: { step: 'ro', octave: 0 }, duration: 4 },
    { pitch: { step: 'tsu', octave: 0 }, duration: 4 },
    // ...more notes
  ],
});
```
