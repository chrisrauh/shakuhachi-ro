# TODO - Shakuhachi Score Library Platform

This file tracks active tasks for the shakuhachi score library platform. Complete tasks in order, complete one task at a time, check if the task hasn't already been implemented, finish a task before starting the next, following the dev workflow defined in `CLAUDE.md`.

## Remaining Tasks

### Visual Regression Testing

- [x] Fix logo showing underlined on score and create score pages
- [ ] Add visual regression tests for Editor page (/editor)
  - [ ] Test default empty state
  - [ ] Test with score data entered
  - [ ] Test viewport and full page screenshots
- [ ] Add visual regression tests for Score page (/score)
  - [ ] Test score rendering (full page and viewport)
  - [ ] Test debug mode
  - [ ] Test different viewport sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile)
- [ ] Update Browse page visual tests to properly test library view
  - [ ] Test empty state (no scores)
  - [ ] Test with scores displayed
  - [ ] Test search/filter interactions
- [ ] Add cross-viewport testing (desktop 1280x720, tablet 768x1024, mobile 375x667)
- [ ] Add visual tests for different auth states (logged in vs logged out)

### Score Renderer Layout Improvements

- [ ] Add mobile breakpoint (< 768px) for single-column vertical scroll layout
- [ ] Test responsive behavior on different screen sizes

### Phase 8: Navigation & UI Polish

- [ ] Create site header component (logo, navigation)
- [ ] Add navigation links: Home | Create Score | My Scores | Profile
- [ ] Add auth UI: Login/Signup or Username/Logout
- [ ] Create footer with attribution
- [ ] Add consistent styling (CSS framework or custom)
- [ ] Implement responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- [ ] Add loading spinners and error states
- [ ] Polish form validation and error messages
- [ ] Test across browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

## Renderer Enhancements (Future)

- [ ] Enable musicians to read through long scores without scrolling (when score exceeds viewport height, allow "page turn" navigation with keyboard/UI controls so players can advance through the score while performing)
- [ ] Add score selector dropdown
- [ ] Load different score files dynamically
- [ ] Add JSDoc comments to public APIs
- [ ] Write usage guide in references/README.md
- [ ] Document score data format

### Additional Modifiers

- [ ] YuriModifier (vibrato)
- [ ] MuraikiModifier (breathy tone)
- [ ] SuriModifier (sliding)
- [ ] OriModifier (pitch bend)
- [ ] Centered duration line style (line passes horizontally through middle of note, alternative to current right-aligned style)

### Performance & Optimization

- [ ] Profile rendering performance
- [ ] Optimize frequent operations
- [ ] Add caching where appropriate
- [ ] Revisit column breaking with TeX-inspired badness algorithm
  - [ ] Implement badness metric for column height variance
  - [ ] Add demerits for orphans (single notes in columns)
  - [ ] Add penalties for breaking at certain notation points
  - [ ] Implement global optimization across score (Knuth-Plass approach)

### Advanced Features (Post-MVP)

- [ ] Visual score editor (point-and-click note entry)
- [ ] OCR tool (scan physical scores to MusicXML/JSON)
- [ ] Collections (curated score groups)
- [ ] Version history (track edits over time)
- [ ] Comments/discussions on scores
- [ ] Pull request workflow (suggest changes to others' scores)
- [ ] Private scores (unlisted or private visibility)
- [ ] Export/download scores as files
- [ ] Print optimization (CSS for clean printouts)
- [ ] Advanced search (filter by tags, difficulty, date ranges)
- [ ] Multiple score input formats (import from ABC, etc.)
- [ ] MIDI playback mapping
- [ ] Western staff intermixing
- [ ] Custom font support for traditional glyphs
